# AI Contribution Detection Tool

A tool that analyzes GitHub commits and code to detect AI-generated contributions and improve transparency in software development.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Problem Title

Detecting AI-Generated Contributions in GitHub Repositories

### Problem Description

Developers increasingly use AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to generate commit messages, code snippets, documentation, and pull requests. However, Git platforms currently have no system to detect or track AI-generated contributions, leading to issues in transparency, accountability, and code quality.

### Target Users

* Software development teams
* Open-source maintainers
* Academic institutions
* Companies enforcing AI usage policies

### Existing Gaps

* No automated detection of AI-generated commits
* No analytics on AI usage in repositories
* No transparency on AI-assisted contributions
* Difficulty enforcing policies on AI usage

---

## 2. Problem Understanding & Approach

### Root Cause Analysis

AI tools generate high-quality text and code that is difficult to distinguish from human work. Developers may submit AI-generated code without full understanding, creating risks in security and maintainability.

### Solution Strategy

Create a tool that analyzes commit messages and code patterns using rule-based heuristics or ML models to assign an **AI Likelihood Score** and provide analytics.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

### Solution Overview

A web tool that checks commit messages and code snippets to estimate whether they were AI-generated.

### Core Idea

Use pattern detection (language style, repetition, formatting) to identify AI-like behavior.

### Key Features

* Detect AI-style commit messages
* Detect AI-generated code patterns
* Assign AI Likelihood Score
* Contributor-level analytics
* Repository-level AI usage trends

### Architecture Description

Our system has five main components:

1. **Frontend (React Web App)**  
   The user pastes a commit message or code snippet and clicks Analyze.

2. **Backend API**  
   Receives the request and sends the data to the detection engine.

3. **AI Detection Engine**  
   Uses rule-based logic to detect AI-style patterns and calculate an AI Likelihood Score.

4. **Database**  
   Stores commit data, AI scores, and analytics information.

5. **Analytics Dashboard**  
   Shows AI usage statistics like contributor trends and AI usage percentage.

This architecture helps teams detect AI-generated contributions and maintain transparency in their repositories.
